* Please read the configuration.txt file for detailed instructions in setting up these files.

02DEC2010: Directory created to process the University of Ottawa
Administrative Data.

08APR2011: This repository is private because it includes the actual data, 
	logs and estimates. I can't really put that out to the public yet.
	
26APR2011: Changed the configuration step by getting rid of the need to run
	setup.do and finalcleanup.do each time. Now all that code is executed in
	the header.do and footer.do files. Simply include them at the beginning of
	each program.
	
	To configure the programs directories, simply run the configure.do program, which
	will create a user_locals.do file. This file is ignored by git, but will be
	included in every program that includes the header file. This is where the directories can
	be specified.
