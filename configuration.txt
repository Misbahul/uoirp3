This Stata do file with walk you through setting up a user_locals.do file that controls where all the included programs will store logs and data files. user_locals.do files are ignored by git. If there is an existing user_locals.do file, a backup will be created. (The backup is also ignored by git.)

2. In order to run many of the table display programs, you must compile some mata code by running master_mata.do.
